        //  Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.

        let arrays = [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5],
            [6]
        ];
        // Your code here.
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


        document.write(arrays.reduce((flat, current) => flat.concat(current), []));

        // I did not understand this concept. Ask Zach to explain this in the next lesson.
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
