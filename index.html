        // 1. First eloquent javascript exersize. I had to look this up. Looks like you need an independent variable outside the for loop with an empty string. I have no idea why this is different than adding another # string value to the triangle vaiable, logging it, and then doing triangle ++

        let triangle = "";
        for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
            triangle += "#";
            console.log(triangle);
        }
    </script>
