Email: **Peter.damicone@gmail.com**

###What I hope to get out of the class:

A deepter knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript to begin my own projects and client projects. I plan on gaining more clients. I also want to be able to plug into the OSU dev team when they need ad-related web things. I also would like to get better at GTM and GA with Javascript and other languages learned in this.
